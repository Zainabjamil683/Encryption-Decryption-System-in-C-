# Encryption-Decryption-System-in-C-
Encryption and decryption system in C++. This is an encryption and decryption system in which it provides option to user that which type of encryption user want. First of all it take message as input from user. Three type of encryption system are Cesar cipher, XOR cipher, and RSA. We make this system through strategy pattern. It gives 5 options to user.  Either to select from these 3 types of encryption or to see previous encrypted data or to exit from the system. The encrypted message will be stored in files and if user presses "4" then the previous encrypted data will be read from file and will be shown on console.
